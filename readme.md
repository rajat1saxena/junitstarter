JUnit testing: beginner demo
---------------------------
This is a starter pack for anyone trying to begin with JUnit, for testing their code.

# Before you begin
The included junit.jar and hamcrest.jar belong to their respective parties. These are not my piece of software. These jars can be downloaded from their respective websites.

# To compile the program
javac -cp ".:<absolute/path/to/current/dir/junit.jar:/absolute/path/to/current/dir/hamcrest.jar" mapy.java mapytester.java mapytestrunner.java

## Note
The Java code included in this setup is mostly a "throw-away" code, so "code quality" and comments are mostly omitted.
